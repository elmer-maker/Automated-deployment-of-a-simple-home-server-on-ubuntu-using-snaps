# Automated-deployment-of-a-simple-home-server-on-ubuntu-using-snaps
Nowadays, user privacy is extremely important. Big-tech services such as Google Drive, online office programs, and others are frequently used to harvest personal data, which can then be used in many different ways. This small project aims to simplify the deployment of a basic home server and make it accessible for non-technical users.
Installation:
1. Install Ubuntu on your computer(any other distribution with the "snapd" package installed would work as well)
2. Download the scripts folder from this repository
